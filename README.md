## Notes

This project aren't completely fulfill the requirements. I'm too lazy to complete it(actually only Top players report is missing). Because I already fullfilled my learning goals.
btw you may notice it already but I didn't use any framework for frontend. because I want this to be as simple as I could.

## Setup

```bash
cd go-real-time-leaderboard
go run .
```
